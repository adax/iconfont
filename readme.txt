Desktop Skeleton - A qooxdoo Application Template using FontAwesome icon fonts
==============================================================================

This is a qooxdoo application skeleton which is used as a template. The 
'create-application.py' script (usually under tool/bin/create-application.py)
will use this and expand it into a self-contained qooxdoo application which 
can then be further extended. Please refer to the script and other documentation
for further information.

What was changed compared to the application generated by a bare 
./create-application.py iconfont call?

1) created the file fonts.json containing the make-font-map job definition
2) added the file fonts.json in config.json in the "include" array.
3) added the job "make-font-map" in the "export" array
4) added the FontAwesome font in the source/class/iconfont/theme/Font.js file
5) added the FontAwesome font files in the source/resource/iconfont/fonts directory
6) changed the button in the skeletop application at source/class/iconfont/Application.js
   to use an icon glyph instead of a png image
